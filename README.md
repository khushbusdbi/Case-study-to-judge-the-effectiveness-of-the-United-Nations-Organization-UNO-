# Case-study-to-judge-the-effectiveness-of-the-United-Nations-Organization-UNO
UNO was formed as a consortium of many nations in the year 1945. Since then, various issues are discussed and voting are done by the various member nations to voice their opinion. The votes by the participating members can be casted as yes or no or abstain. Over a period of time, different countries have been voicing their opinion on the voting patterns. Views have been given how the important issues are not discussed timely and the how different countries are forming cartels to further their own interests. The present case study uses the voting datasets available to draw conclusions on some of the objections raised by the participating countries. This case study investigates these charges specifically from India's standpoint.

1. Prepare an appropriate graph for listing all the issues discussed at the UN along with their frequency
and comment on the above charge.

2. On charges that relevant topics are not being discussed on priority, some participating members
pointed out that to defend US, the issue of Nuclear weapons was not discussed immediately after the
UN was formed. The panel asks to you investigate and tell when on what date was the issue of Nuclear
weapons and nuclear material first discussed at the UN.
Considering that UN started its sessions in 1946. Japan has just witnessed two nuclear attacks by US.
Many participating countries expected this to be discussed within the first 10 issues that were voted on.
Do you think a relevant topic like Nuclear weapons was discussed too late?

3. The Secretary General of the UN once commented that the countries that abstain from the voting do
so to serve their own interest. It was not good on their part not to take a stand on issues which have a
global impact. To check the gravity of this remark and on what issues does this happen most often investigate and find out for which listed issue have the countries abstained themselves from voting the
most

4. To give credit to the countries that take a clear stand most often (by voting as Yes or No) Which
country/ countries has casted the greatest number of votes (ONLY as Yes or No) across all the voting

5. Some countries have reported two most important issues facing the world in the 21st century as the
Human rights and Economic development. Post 1st January 2000, how many voting have taken place for
these two issues separately. What is the combined proportion of these two issues out of all the
discussions that have taken place? They expected at least one third of the debates should have taken
place on these two issues. What does the data indicate?

6. Pakistan keeps raising issues of Human right in Kashmir which India has openly refuted. It refuses to
participate in any such debates saying that Kashmir has been an internal matter for India. Because of
this it has to abstain itself from voting on issues related to Human rights. How many times did India
abstain from the voting where Human rights issues were being discussed? What is the proportion?

7. In general, how has been India's track record in taking a specific position in the debates carried out at
the UN. Specially for the issues that have been flagged as important. In what proportion of voting rated
as important (importantvote value is specified as 1) did India abstain from voting? How does the
proportion change if the votes where importance has not been specified are included as important?
Compare the proportion for India against the proportion of absenteeism of US from important issues
and draw your conclusions.

8. Because of the improvements in the ties between US and India over the last few years, Indian
governments have been receiving flaks from various sections on supporting US blindly to further their
ties. Calculate the proportion of voting when India and US have casted the same vote. Compare the
proportions before and after 2001 and draw your conclusions.

9. It is also said that while in the past India was siding with Russia more often than with US, recently in
cases where US and Russia have voted oppositely, India has sided with US more often. Compare and
contrast the proportions before and after 2001 to check this claim and draw your conclusions.

10. Make an appropriate graph to showcase how the proportion of voting where India votes as Yes has
varied over the time
